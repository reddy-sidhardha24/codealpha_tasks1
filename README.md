# 🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

A clean and beginner-friendly **text-based Hangman game**, implemented entirely in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and allows the player to guess letters or the entire word. The player gets **6 wrong attempts**, following classic Hangman rules.

This project demonstrates essential Python programming concepts such as **randomization, loops, conditionals, string handling, sets, and console input/output**.
Perfect for students, beginners, or anyone learning basic Python logic.
